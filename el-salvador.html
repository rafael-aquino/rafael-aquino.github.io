<h2 id="we-have-a-lot-of-good-things-to-share-with-the-world">We have a lot of good things to share with the world.</h2>

<p>It’s Probably  the first time you hear about our country, El Salvador.
Most of the time when we are mentioned, you only hear bad news or the problems we are having.
But let me share with you some of the most innovative, inspiring people and projects that we have.</p>

<h3 id="companies">Companies</h3>

<p><a href="https://elaniin.com/">Elaniin Tech Company</a></p>

<p>Company that started in Adrián Gómez’s garage. Elaniin Tech Company has decided to expand to more extensive and interactive offices, also multiply their knowledge through <a href="https://www.bitlab.edu.sv/">BitLab</a> a training center, which trains at least 150 young people per year in programming skills and entrepreneurship, they hire the best professionals to include them in the organization.</p>

<p>Elaniin already has more than 50 employees and each month is hiring between 6 and 7 more programmers because the demand for their services has grown exponentially.</p>

<p><a href="https://applaudostudios.com/">Applaudo Studio</a></p>

<p>They were born as a start-up in 2011 when Darwin Romero and José Luis Giammattei started outsourcing services for a client in the United States. The idea has evolved to serve corporations with high international standards.</p>

<p>The digital transformation of many companies that occurs before and after 2020 will double the demand for software developers in the world. With that business focus, Applaudo Studios has become a center for high-tech software development with clients such as Fox, Coca-Cola, CBS, Pfizer or the Hyat hotel chain.</p>

<p><a href="https://uassistme.co/">Uassist.ME</a></p>

<p>This Salvadoran company has become a point of reference in the outsourcing industry. It went from a BPO approach to a collaborative economy, in different areas such as real estate.</p>

<p>Within its offer, it has developed the <a href="https://point.com.sv/">POINT</a> Project, a shared office center for young entrepreneurs and innovators now part of <a href="https://impacthub.net/">Impact Hub</a> network and <a href="http://www.live.sv/">LIVE</a>, an initiative for youth accommodation, located in the historic center of San Salvador . Under these three business modalities, Uassist.ME has grown in the Central American region, and has already been part of the Inc5000 List in 2017.</p>
